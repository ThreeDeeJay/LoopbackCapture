## What is Loopback Capture

Loopback Capture is a tool which can be used to capture the loopback from audio devices.

## Build (Windows)

The `win32\csharp` and `win32\dll` version require some packages, before you build it, you need to install these packages and put dll files to `3rdparty` folder:

* CSCore - An advanced audio library, written in C#.
* Unmanaged Exports - DllExport for .Net.

Suggest to use NuGet to install them:

```
nuget install .\build\packages.config
```

Then in MSBuild Command Prompt:
```
> build.all.bat
or
> build.cpp.bat
or
> build.csharp.bat
or
> build.dll.bat
```

## Install Soundflower (macOS)

macOS not support to capture Loopback from device directly. The workaround is to route what is playing on the computer digitally back to the input without using a cable.

Soundflower is a free open source system add-on for Mac computers that allows you to route what is playing on the computer digitally back to the input without using a cable. Set Soundflower as your system output device, then in Audacity, set Soundflower as your recording device.

You can get compiled Soundflower kernel extension in here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases

About how to setup device, there is an example in Release Note please take a look.

## Install Avconv Tool (Linux)

avconv is a part from "libav-tools" package which is support to record audio use command line with specific format specific duration and from specific device.

```
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```

BTW, the pulsectl is required for `linux\LoopbackCapture.py`, use following command to install it:

```
pip install pulsectl
```

## Usage

```
# CSharp

> LoopbackCapture.exe <output/wav> <time/milliseconds>

# C++

> LoopbackCapture.exe -?
> LoopbackCapture.exe --list-devices
> LoopbackCapture.exe [--device "Device long name"] [--file "file name"] [--time "capture milliseconds"] [--int-16]
    -? prints this message.
    --list-devices displays the long names of all active playback devices.
    --device captures from the specified device (default if omitted)
    --file saves the output to a file
    --time capture specific milliseconds
    --int-16 attempts to coerce data to 16-bit integer format

# Python (DLL)

> import os, sys, platform, clr
> if platform.architecture()[0] == "32bit":
>     DLL_PATH = r"bin\x86\Release"
> elif platform.architecture()[0] == "64bit":
>     DLL_PATH = r"bin\x64\Release"
> DLL_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), DLL_PATH)
> sys.path.append(DLL_PATH)
> clr.AddReference("LoopbackCapture")
> from LoopbackCapture import LoopbackCapture
> lc = LoopbackCapture()
> lc.Capture("record.wav", 15000)

# Python (macOS)

> from mac.LoopbackCapture import record_sounds
> exit_code = record_sounds(audio_file, milliseconds)

# Python (Linux)

> from linux.LoopbackCapture import record_sounds
> exit_code = record_sounds(audio_file, milliseconds)
```
